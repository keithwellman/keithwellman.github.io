Maybe that title is a bit of a stretch but hear me out. 

It was 2004 when I developed my first website. Oh I remember the days of using Microsoft Frontpage to build out my static webpages. Complete with images, fancy table layouts, and abysmal code. My experience with code at the time was limited to my 1999 senior year elective web developement class. Which is to say, next to nil. Frontpage was a WYSIWYG editor that was perfect for my needs at the time. Until it wasn't. 

As my website grew, so did the complexity. Minor changes took hours of manually changing font colors, inline styles, and fixing code that seemed to break if I dared change a single table attribute. Fast forward...

Taking the time to learn and master HTML fundementals is vital for so many reasons. Using a shared language, well structured layout, and solid standards are increasingly important to productivity. For example, the now common column sturcture "col-md-6" naming convention is well understood by professionals. I can easily collaborate on projects and accomplish far more with more efficiency than I ever could if I stuck to my lone-ranger WYSIWYG tape-it-together and make it work methods of the late 90's.   

HTML fundementals shouldn't be like a box of chocolates. You should always know what you're going to get. 

* Well documented code. 
* A naming convention that can be quickly understood. 
* Readability. 
* Elegance. 

Maybe not the perfect metaphor but I think it'll do. So the next time you consider some inline styles or a universal css selector as a quick fix, remember this metaphor and go back to the fundamentals.
