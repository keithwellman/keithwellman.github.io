Why did I decide to learn software development? 

I didn't. I decided that the problems I wanted to solve, require the use of software development. For me, willingness to put in the practice required, love of knowledge (wisdom), and dedication to mastery involved in software development come from a far more meaningful ~~desire~~ need. The art of expressive problem solving. 

Ferociously taking notes, and doing my best to not be completely lost, I was listening to my discrete math professor deliver his lecture when he kindly let the class know that "Computer Scientists" were not "actual scientists." 

Defensive, I was. Much to learn, I had. 

He was right. It's not a science. Science is much too rigid to be any fun for me. Recording thousands of pieces of data in a seemingly endless loop sounds like pure \<insert colorful word here\> torture. I love science though and there is no contradiction! With software development, I'm solving problems and creating solutions. That's exciting. I can experiment millions of times in incomprehensibly short periods of times. I can instantly see results and iterate over solutions. A power tool that has solved and continues to solve some of the worlds most fundamental and challenging problems. 

If it's not a science, what is it?

[It's a scientific approach to computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science) and relies heavily on math. "Boo! No math!" you say? 

Fortunately for me, I don't have to be a math wizard to qualify and neither do you. There are a wide-range of careers under that umbrella and most don't require strong math. While discrete math is quite important for long term growth if you intend to solve increasingly complex problems, there's a whole world of software development that requires only the most basic understanding of maths. P.E.M.D.A.S. is about as complex as it gets.   

With just an elementary understanding of math and having learned software development, I can create professional websites, write software programs that automate repetitive tasks, and express my creativity by solving many challenges along the way. It's fun!

It's also time-consuming. 

It takes a commitment to practice, like anything in life, to master. You can have fun with it and dabble investing only a few minutes a day or you can jump in and invest as much time as you have. Interesting problems lay ahead but it's the journey that is most important. Software development can solve many of them. Start small. That's the first step. I find that learning new languages and frameworks comes from the need to solve more difficult problems. Full Stack Web Development, for example, will allow me to create useful web applications and connect people from all over the world.

Where will this take me? That's unimportant. 

How can I contribute in a meaningful way while expressing my art of problem solving? Software development.
